## Installation of VS Code on Windows 11

There are no specific prerequisites for installing VS Code on Windows 11. Here's how to do it:

1. **Download:** Visit the official VS Code download page [https://code.visualstudio.com/download](https://code.visualstudio.com/download).
2. **Choose Version:** Download the installer for Windows (64-bit).
3. **Run Installer:** Double-click the downloaded installer and follow the on-screen instructions. It's recommended to keep the default settings during installation.

## First-time Setup for Optimal Coding

After installation, consider these adjustments:

* **Themes:** Go to **File > Preferences > Settings (or Code > Preferences > Settings on macOS)**. Search for "Theme" and explore different themes to find one that suits your preference. Popular options include Dark+ (default dark theme) and One Dark Pro.
* **Extensions:** Open the Extensions view (**Ctrl+Shift+X**). Explore popular extensions like:
    * **ESLint:** Linter for JavaScript code.
    * **Prettier:** Code formatter for consistent style.
    * **Live Server:** Launches a local server to preview web pages directly in the browser.
* **Settings:** Adjust font size under **"Editor > Font Size"**. You can also customize keyboard shortcuts under **"Keyboard Shortcuts"**.

## User Interface Overview

The VS Code interface consists of several key areas:

* **Activity Bar (left):** Provides access to various functionalities like managing extensions, debugging, and Git integration.
* **Side Bar (left):** Displays your project folders, open files, and the integrated terminal.
* **Editor Group (center):** The main workspace where you write and edit your code. You can have multiple editors open in tabs.
* **Status Bar (bottom):** Shows information like current line number, indentation mode, and Git status.

## Command Palette

The Command Palette (**Ctrl+Shift+P**) is a powerful tool that lets you access all VS Code features and settings through a search bar. You can use it for various tasks, such as:

* Opening specific files or folders.
* Running build tasks or starting debugging sessions.
* Installing or managing extensions. 

## Extensions in VS Code

Extensions add functionalities beyond VS Code's core features. Here's how to manage them:

* **Finding Extensions:** Open the Extensions view (**Ctrl+Shift+X**). Browse categories or search for specific functionalities.
* **Installing Extensions:** Click the "Install" button next to the desired extension.
* **Managing Extensions:** You can view installed extensions, update them, or disable/uninstall them from the Extensions view.

**Essential Extensions for Web Development:**

* **ESLint:** Linting for JavaScript/TypeScript.
* **Prettier:** Code formatting for consistent style.
* **Live Server:** Launches a local server for live preview.
* **Debugger for Chrome/Firefox:** Enables debugging web applications in those browsers.

## Integrated Terminal

The integrated terminal (**Terminal** tab in the Panel) allows you to run command-line tools directly within VS Code. This eliminates the need to switch between VS Code and a separate terminal window.

## File and Folder Management

* **Create Files/Folders:** Right-click in the Side Bar or an existing folder and select "New File" or "New Folder".
* **Open Files:** Double-click a file in the Side Bar or use the **Go to File** feature (**Ctrl+G**).
* **Navigation:** Use the Side Bar to navigate folders. You can also use keyboard shortcuts like **Ctrl+T** to open new tabs and switch between them.

## Settings and Preferences

Settings allow you to customize VS Code's behavior. Access them through **File > Preferences > Settings (or Code > Preferences > Settings on macOS)**. Here are some examples:

* **Change Theme:** Search for "Theme" and select your preference.
* **Font Size:** Go to **"Editor > Font Size"**.
* **Keybindings:** Search for "Keyboard Shortcuts" and modify keybindings for specific actions.

## Debugging in VS Code

1. **Set Breakpoints:** Click on the line number where you want to pause execution.
2. **Start Debugging:** Open the Command Palette (**Ctrl+Shift+P**) and search for "Start Debugging". Choose the appropriate debug configuration.
3. **Step Through Code:** Use the debugger controls (play, pause, step) to execute your code line by line and inspect variables.

**Debugging Features:**

* Setting breakpoints to pause execution at specific lines.
* Stepping through code line by line.
* Inspecting variable values during execution.

## Using Source Control with Git

VS Code integrates seamlessly with Git for version control. Here's a basic workflow:

1. **Initialize Repository
 Open the integrated terminal and navigate to your project directory using cd. Run git init to create a new Git repository.
2. Stage Changes: Use the Source Control view (Source Control tab in the Panel) to stage specific files or folders for version control.
3. Commit Changes: Enter a commit message describing your changes and run git commit -m "Your message" in the terminal.
4. Push to GitHub: Create a remote repository on GitHub and link it to your local repository. Use git push origin main (replace "main" with your branch name) to push your committed changes to GitHub.
